#### long long time ago in a galaxy far far away...

I recieved my BSc in Cognitive Science and Neuroscience at the University of Toronto where I fell in love philosophy of mind and neural computations. My cognitive science advisor was [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php) with whom I studied latent variable spiking models. My advisor in neuroscience was [Franco Taverna](http://hmb.utoronto.ca/profiles/franco-taverna/) with whom I developed the first neuroscience concept inventory for an undergraduate neuroscience curriculum. 

To get my MSc, I went to work with [Matt van der Meer](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/matthijs-van-der-meer) at the University of Waterloo where I was introduced to animal work for the first time! There, I was co-advised by [Jeff Orchard](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jorchard/UWaterloo/Home.html) in the Computer Science department who helped me begin my work on computationally modelling hippocampal replay. 

My stay at Waterloo was short lived however and I moved to Dartmouth College with the van der Meer lab where I am currently a PhD student!
