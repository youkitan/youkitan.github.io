### I'm a ~~foodie~~ culinary adventurer
I have an obsession with spicy food. I'm in a love-hate relationship with exotic potato chip flavors, and I make it a point to have ramen in every major city I visit. Here are some of my favourite ramen shops:

[Yoshimuraya](https://en.japantravel.com/kanagawa/yoshimuraya-ramen/23632), Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan  
[Sansotei](http://www.sansotei.com), Toronto, ON Canada  
[Yokato Yokabai](http://www.yoka.ca), Montreal, QC Canada  
[Strings](https://www.ramenchicago.com/#the-kitchen), Chicago, IL USA

### I widthstand sunlight
When not nocturnal, I really enjoy playing competetive sports like soccer. I'm also into hiking, snowboarding and outdoor heights in general. Occasionally, I take pretty pictures. Below is an example from the top of Mt. Tsubakuro in Nagano, Japan:

### I'm totally l33t
Video games, card games, board games, word games -- I love all the games! In true nerd fashion, I also enjoy D&D, anime, and stupid, impossible hand puzzles.
