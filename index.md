Welcome to my webpage! I'm currently a third year PhD student in [Psychological & Brain Sciences](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth College. I work with [Matthijs van der Meer](http://pbs.dartmouth.edu/people/matthijs-van-der-meer) and my research focuses on understanding the content of internally generated hippocampal sequences, commonly known as "replay", and how they relate to the structure of memory and motivational states. I study these phenomena using in-vivo electrophysiology in rats and state-of-the-art computational methods.

Besides my primary research, I am a strong advocate of open science and multidisciplinary approaches. Similar to the increasing demand for translational research, I believe that a kind of intersectional research – of “*scopes to scanners*” – will be required to understand how circuit level computations instantiate person level phenomena. As such, I am always looking for ways to open new dialogues between human and non-human researchers and experimental and computational minds.  

TL;DR - If you've got a crazy idea you want to try in rats, [let me know](mailto:youkitan.gr@dartmouth.edu)!
